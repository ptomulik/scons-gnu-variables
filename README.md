SConsGnuVariables
=================

Welcome to SConsGnuVariables.

This package provides SCons with GNU variables (e.g. direcory wariables)
commonly used by GNU Makefiles. You may easilly add to your command line
variables or options such as $prefix or $bindir.

INSTALLATION
------------

Just copy entire directory SConsGnuVariables to your local ``site_scons``.

    cp -r scons-gnu-variables/SConsGnuVariables your/project/site_scons/

USAGE
-----

See API documentation (you may need to generate it, see *DOCUMENTATION*).
Here is an example of what may be put to ``SConsctruct`` in order to add
all supported GNU directory variables to your scons command line variables

```python
    # SConstruct #
    from SConsGnuVariables import GnuDirVariables
    env = Environment()
    gnuvars = GnuDirVariables.AsSConsVariables()
    gnuvars.Update(env, ARGUMENTS)
    print "${prefix}: ", env.subst('${prefix}')
    print "${bindir}: ", env.subst('${bindir}')
``` 

The result of ``scons -Q`` will be

    ${prefix}:  /usr/local
    ${bindir}:  /usr/local/bin
    scons: `.' is up to date.

The result of ``scons -Q prefix=/usr`` will be

    ${prefix}:  /usr
    ${bindir}:  /usr/bin
    scons: `.' is up to date.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

API documentation can be generated from top level directory with the following
command
